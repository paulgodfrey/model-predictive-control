# Model Predictive Control

Model predictive control reframes the task of following a target trajectory as an optimization problem. The solution to that problem is to find the optimal trajectory for the vehicle.

The optimal trajectory can be found by taking the vehicles current state and then simulating different control inputs (steering, accelerating, braking) to see how they impact the vehicles trajectory.

In this controller I've used kinematic motion model to predict the vehicles trajectory under different control inputs. Using this model you can be predict the vehicles trajectory given it's previous state:

### Predicting a vehicles trajectory at timestep t + 1
```
x​t + 1 ​​= xt ​​+ vt ​​∗ cos(psit) ∗ dt // x coordinate
y​t + 1 ​​= yt ​​+ vt ​​∗ sin(psi​t) ∗ dt // y coordinate
psit + 1 ​​= psit ​​+ ​L​f/​vt ​​∗ δt ​​∗ dt // heading, δ is steering angle
v​t + 1 ​​= v​t ​​+ a​t ∗ dt // velocity
```

Note: When calculating psi​t + 1 we use an additional variable Lf to represent the difference between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity (the larger the vehicle, the slower its turn rate).

Once you know the simulated trajectory for a given set of control inputs you can compute the crosstrack (cte) and orientation (epsi) errors. The path with the minimum cost will be closest to the target trajectory.

### Calculate the orientation error (epsi​) at timestep t + 1:
```
epsit = psi​t - - ψ​dest // current eψ is desired orientation subtracted from current orientation
vt/Lf * steert * dt // change in error caused by vehicles movement
epsi​t + 1 = epsit + vt/Lf * steert * dt
```

### Calculate the crosstrack error at timestep t + 1:
```
ctet = f(xt) - yt // current cte
vt * sin(epsit) * dt // change in error caused by vehicles movement
ctet + 1 = f(xt) - yt + (vt * sin(epsit) * dt)
```

When calculating the cost for steering and speed across a trajectory it's important to penalize jerky steering or rapid changes in velocity (think of every terrible yellow taxi ride you've ever had). This is accomplished by tuning the coefficients when calculating cost for those inputs (see MPC.cpp lines 50-75).

```
// cost based on the reference state.
for (int t = 0; t < N; t++) {
  // increase coefficients to magnify cost of control variables
  fg[0] += 2000*CppAD::pow(vars[cte_start + t] - ref_cte, 2);
  fg[0] += 2000*CppAD::pow(vars[epsi_start + t] - ref_epsi, 2);
  fg[0] += CppAD::pow(vars[v_start + t] - ref_v, 2);
}
```

### Adding constraints to simulated input

As part of the model for simulating trajectory it's also important to introduce constraints on your input controls both for computational efficiency and to emulate real world inputs as closely as possible. As an example when you're driving a vehicle it's never going to be turn on a dime at a 90 degree angle — for this reason I've constrained the steering wheel angle in the simulations to -25 <-> 25 degrees.   

```
// upper and lower limits of delta are set to -25 and 25
// degrees (values in radians)
for (int i = delta_start; i < a_start; i++) {
  vars_lowerbound[i] = -0.436332*Lf;
  vars_upperbound[i] = 0.436332*Lf;
}
```

After finding the optimal trajectory, steering and throttle adjustments are sent to the actuator. While the model has calculated a series of controls over the time horizon (N*dt) everything outside of the first timestep is thrown out (note: in MPC.cpp I use the actuator controls at the second timestep - this is because i'm simulating a 100ms delay (N=10 and dt=0.1) for processing on an embedded system).

Instead of using the old predicted trajectory, you take the new state from vehicle sensors (x, y, psi, v) and calculate a new optimal trajectory (i.e. this whole process runs in a continuous loop). This approach is also called "receding horizon control" because you're constantly calculating inputs over a future horizon.

Note: While the track simulator (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) returns waypoints using the maps coordinate system it's important to transform the target trajectory so that it's horizontal to the car:

```
// transform waypoints so they are horizontal to car
for(int i = 0; i < ptsx.size(); i++) {

  // shift car reference angle to 90 degrees
  double shift_x = ptsx[i] - px;
  double shift_y = ptsy[i] - py;

  // rotate all points so that psi is 0
  ptsx[i] = (shift_x * cos(0 - psi) - shift_y * sin(0 - psi));
  ptsy[i] = (shift_x * sin(0 - psi) + shift_y * cos(0 - psi));
}
```

       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/) or the [Github releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases) page.
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`.
